This is my first project at Thinkful data science bootcamp. 
The goal of the project is to analyze patterns / findings within a database that consists of 30,000 credit card customers. The tools used are mostly stats tool within Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Stats and others). 
The dataset is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients.
